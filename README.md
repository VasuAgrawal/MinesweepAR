MinesweepAR
======

MinesweepAR is an augmented reality version of the classic game MinesweepAR,
played on your cell phone on a gigantic 12' x 12' physical board! Even better,
you can play together with your friends at the same time! An Android app is used
to overlay the game board over the camera feed, and a server manages the game
state for all connected GUIs and phones.
